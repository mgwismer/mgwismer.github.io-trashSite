This site was created as part of a week 1 assignment at the NYCDA web intensive 
course at 1601 Cherry St. in Philadelphia. In addition to making a functioning 
website while collaborating with other developers, the intent was to create a site 
using media queries to elegantly resize the site for mutltiple screen sizes. We hope you enjoy the whimsy and the ideas herein.
